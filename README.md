This project focuses on predicting the price of used cars based on various attributes. The dataset includes specifications, seller details, condition, and other relevant factors for over 50,000 records. Using Machine Learning algorithms like Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Trees, we built predictive models to estimate the price of used cars accurately. The project aims to assist car sellers and buyers by providing reliable price predictions.
